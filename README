NAME
    RT-Extension-DynamicWebPath - Dynamic WebPath

DESCRIPTION
    This extension adds dynamic WebPath support to RT, each WebPath can have
    its own configurations.

    This can be used to support different auth methods, e.g. "" for SSO and
    "/rt" for RT internal login.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 5

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt5/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::DynamicWebPath');

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt5/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

Configuration
    Assuming "" is to use SSO, "/rt" is to use RT internal login:

        Set( %DynamicWebPath,
            '' => {
                WebRemoteUserAuth    => 1,
                WebFallbackToRTLogin => 0,
            },
            '/rt' => {
                WebRemoteUserAuth    => 0,
                WebFallbackToRTLogin => 1,
            },
        );

    The corresponding configs are set automatically when RT detects WebPath
    changes by checking HTTP request URL.

    In apache config, add the following directive before normal setup:

        ScriptAlias /rt /opt/rt5/sbin/rt-server.fcgi/

    Also remember to turn off SSO for /rt, e.g.

        <LocationMatch "^/(rt|REST)(/|$)">
            MellonEnable off
            Require all granted
        </LocationMatch>
